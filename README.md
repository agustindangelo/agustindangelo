## Hi! 👋😄 you're welcome

#### About me
I'm Agustín D'Angelo, a 21 years-old senior Systems Engineering student from 📍 Rosario, Argentina. I consider myself a proactive and curious person and I'm passionate about computers and how these enable us to build great things to improve people's lives. 

Although I worked on many interesting topics during the course of my bachelor's degree, here are some projects that I highlight:

##### 📊 Data-related projects
- 📈 **Signal processing of the machinery at a chemical plant**: I worked for two years on a research project related to data analysis from industrial machinery of a chemical plant, in collaboration with the University Ilmenau Technique, Germany.

- 🌾 **Crop images analysis**: I worked on a research project in which we analyzed satellite images of regional crops for the prediction of yields, in collaboration with a recognized company of digital agriculture services and the University of Maryland.

- 🚴 **Simulation of the bike sharing system of Rosario**: We built a simulation model of the public bicycle system to evaluate design alternatives and choose the one that provides the greatest benefits in terms of user satisfaction and CO2 avoided. Check it out [here](https://github.com/agustindangelo/mibicitubici-simulacion).

##### 🧑‍💻 Software development projects
- 👩‍⚕️ **Diet-tracking web app for Nutritionists**: As a final project for the Java Programming Language course, we developed a web platform so that nutritionists can track physical activity and food intakes from their patients. Technologies: Java, Javascript, MySQL, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. Check it out [here](https://github.com/agustindangelo/Java-UTN).

- 🎨 **Freelance services marketplace _(in progress)_**:
As a final project for the subject _Advanced Software Development Techniques and Technologies_, we developed a marketplace 
Como trabajo  para la asignatura Técnicas y Tecnologías Avanzadas de Desarrollo de Software,
desarrollamos una plataforma para la prestación y contratación de servicios. Technologies: Angular,
Node, GraphQL Javascript, Typescript, MongoDB. Check out [the repo](https://github.com/GianfrancoRaselli/tp-backend).

- 🎮 **Hangman Game _(in progress)_**:
As a final project for the subject _Agile frameworks for software development_, we developed the classical hangman game to apply Scrum, Kanban, TDD, ATDD/BDD, CI/CD and pair programming. Check it out [here](https://github.com/agustindangelo/ahorcado-tdd).
